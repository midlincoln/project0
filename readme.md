I am Ovanes Oganisian from Moscow Russia and my project 0 is about wrestling...
This is my sport and i am trying to stay in touch with it. At times its difficult.

In this project i am trying to search for connection between where i am now with wrestling. So I created website called ogwrestlingsystem.com to reach out into my past. Actually I wanted to do it long time ago, but I could not move beyond first page. I worked on home page from time to time for a few years. But with this task of completing project 0 I added 3 more pages to this website. 
A page called Coming Back to shape
A page called Former Spartak Baumanskaie
A Page called Virtual Wrestling

So my project contains 4 web pages

1.On homepage i present info about me and my brother we both were very acclaimed wrestlers in the past.
i show videos with me and my brother of different wrestling moves, that i recorded over time. I also show some videos of historic matches with us I found on the internet. 
And i have included  a side bar of different wrestling news.

2. A page "coming back to shape" contains short summary of steps one would take to come back in shape and start wrestle again. This page also has a news side bar summarizing news on relevant to coming back to shape topics

3. On a page "Spartak Baumanskaia" I pay dues to my former wrestling club in Moscow and present pictures and videos with old team mates. On this page I also show news column with news and other resources about Moscow district where our club used to reside and about Spartak, which was the name of the club.

4. on  page "Virtual wrestling" I set up stage to connect wrestling with artificial intelligence. While this is a very ambitious task, I start with simple connections between wrestling and known systems where AI is successful such as chess, and mazes. 
i present a few similarities between wrestling and chess and mazes.
On this page  i also summarise news on wrestling video games and other virtual sports.

My website is mobile friendly and can be view on hand held device with most of the formatting preserved.

i would have used different formatting on some pages, but because i had to complete tasks outlined in project 0 
i had to sacrifice consistency of formatting to accomplish this tasks.
